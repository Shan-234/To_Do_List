# TO-DO LIST PROJECT
**This project is about building a program that acts as a To-Do List giving users the ability to add, delete, update, and view tasks.**

# Add task:
**Test adding a single task to the empty list. (Done)
Test adding multiple tasks to the list. (Done)
Test adding tasks with different descriptions and priorities. (Pending)
Test adding tasks with special characters and spaces in the description. (Done)
Test adding tasks with duplicate descriptions. (Done)
Test inputting duplicate names for multiple different tasks. (Pending)**

# Delete task:
**Test deleting a task from the list with only one task. (Done)
Test deleting a task from the list with multiple tasks. (Pending)
Test deleting a task that doesn't exist in the list. (Pending)
Test deleting tasks based on different criteria such as task number or description. (Pending)**

# View tasks:
**Test viewing an empty task list. (Pending)
Test viewing a task list with multiple tasks. (Done)
Test viewing tasks with different sorting orders (e.g., by priority, by due date). (Discard)
Test viewing a subset of tasks based on filters (e.g., view only high priority tasks, view tasks due today). (Discard)**

# Update task:
**Test updating the description of a task. (Done)
Test updating the priority of a task. (Discard)
Test updating the due date of a task. (Discard)
Test updating multiple attributes of a task simultaneously. (Pending)
Test updating a task that doesn't exist in the list. (Pending)**

# Error handling:
**Test inputting invalid commands or options and ensure proper error messages are displayed. (Pending)
Test handling invalid input for task attributes (e.g., entering a non-integer priority, an invalid date format). (Discard)**

# Persistence: (DISCARD)
**Test closing and reopening the program to ensure the tasks are persisted correctly.
Test saving and loading tasks from a file to ensure data integrity.
These test cases cover various scenarios that your to-do list program should handle. You can expand on them or customize them further based on your specific requirements and functionalities.**
